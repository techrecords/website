> This article describes yet another solution for a synchronous multiroom audio. It contains device demo, detailed hardware & communication & software design, HOW-TOs with the links to the configs, benefits and drawbacks of this solution, things that I want to improve and my feedback after using it.

## Description

The audio player streams audio from a linux-based PC while been connected to the same WI-FI network and integrated into a Home Assistant (HA) server. No internet or cloud access is needed, only local WI-FI access. The audio player has following features:

* displayed play/stop toggle button
* displayed volume slider
* displayed current time, WI-FI signal level
* timeout to turn off display when no activities detected
* 2 physical buttons to control player and 1 button to reset
* remote control over HA


Short demo of the player: Start/stop commands (locally and over HA), volume adjustment, backlight turn on due to button press:

## Player Wiring Diagram

![Picture of player Wiring Diagram](/_images/ha-sync-hw-connection.png "Wiring diagram of the synchronous multiroom audio player") {.wp-post-image}

Player consists of the following elements:
* [T-Display S3 (ESP32-S3 + 1.9 inch display, Version: H569)](https://lilygo.cc/en-pl/products/t-display-s3)
* [T-Display S3 Shell, Version: L929](https://lilygo.cc/en-pl/products/t-display-s3-shell)
* **I2S DAC Audio Decoder UDA1334A** (there are many versions on the market)

## Communication diagram between components

![Picture of communication diagram between components](/_images/ha-sync-communication.png "Communication Diagram of all components in the project") {.wp-post-image}

## The list of the used software of the components

__PC with Linux-based OS__
* [pulse-audio daemon](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/)
* [icecast2 daemon](https://icecast.org/)
* [butt, icecast client](https://danielnoethen.de/butt/)

__Raspberry PI__
* [Home Assistant server](https://www.home-assistant.io/)

__Audio Player__
* [ESPHome-based flashware](https://esphome.io/)

## HOW-TO set up linux-based PC as a streaming source

* make sure [Pulse Audio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Download/) is installed
* open UI PulseAudio Volume Control app
* go to tab "Input Devices", down in the menu select "Show: Monitors", adjust the volume of your monitor channel
* choose your streaming device by clicking on "Set as Fallback" button

![Picture of PulseAudio, Input Devices menu](/_images/ha-sync-pulse-audio.png "PulseAudio, Input Devices menu") {.wp-post-image}

* install [icecast2](https://icecast.org/download/) service, responsible for converting PCM stream to icecast format
* edit icecast configuration file, (usually it's located in */etc/icecast2/icecast.xml*). You need to change \<source-password\> (pass for the tools, that stream the source), \<admin-password\> (admin pass), \<admin-user\> (any nickname), \<hostname\> (IP address of your PC), \<port\> (could be 8000) fields
* restart icecast:
```
sudo systemctl restart icecast2
```
* install [butt](https://danielnoethen.de/butt/) streaming tool, for streaming icecast over http.
* open butt:

- Go to the Settings. on the "Main" tab choose "Add Server".

![Picture of Settings menu of Butt](/_images/ha-sync-butt-edit-menu.png "Settings menu of Butt") {.wp-post-image}

- Define "name", select Server Type as "Icecast", port, IP address and password should be equal to \<port\>,  \<hostname\>, \<source-password\> from icecast configuration. "Icecast mountpoint:"  is a postfix for stream URL, for example: **http://\<hostname\>:\<port\>/\<postfix\>**

## HOW-TO set up & flash audio player for receiving audio stream

- Make sure you have all hardware components described above
- to put DAC Decoder I had to adapt it and also adapt T-Display Shell, see the picture:

![Picture after fixing T-Display S3 & I2S DAC Audio Decoder](/_images/ha-sync-hw-fixes.jpg "After fixing T-Display S3 & I2S DAC Audio Decoder") {.wp-post-image}

- do the soldering according to the diagram above. That's how it looked for me:

![Picture after soldering T-Display S3 & I2S DAC Audio Decoder](/_images/ha-sync-soldering.jpg "After soldering T-Display S3 & I2S DAC Audio Decoder") {.wp-post-image}

- Install ESPhome IDE according to the [guide](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio)
- connect and flash audio player using YAML config file:
```
esphome run ha-audio-sync-config.yaml
```
YAML file is located [here](https://github.com/techrecords/ha-configs/blob/main/ha-audio-sync/ha-audio-sync-config.yaml)

**IMPORTANT: In the config file specify SSID, WI-FI password and URL for the audio source stream, which is defined in butt**

## HOW-TO connect audio player to Home Assistant

Once the audio player is flashed with correct WI-FI credentials, it will be automatically discovered with Home Assistant platform. Enter convenient name for it.

![Picture of discovered audio player in Home Assistant](/_images/ha-sync-ha-discovery-esphome.png "Discovered audio player in Home Assistant") {.wp-post-image} 

After adding the audio player to the list of the devices, find "Entity Id" of the player by going in to Settings -> ESPHome -> Entities -> "Name of your player" -> Settings.

![Picture of Media Player Settings in Home Assistant](/_images/ha-sync-ha-entity-id.png "Media Player Settings in Home Assistant") {.wp-post-image} 

Copy it and replace default entity id ("media_player.s3_esphome_i2s_media_player") with yours in YAML config file. The reflashing of the audio player with new configuration is required. It's needed for state synchronization of the player in HA and the device.

## Benefits and Drawbacks

* 🙂 does not require any code development
* 🙂 compare to Bluetooth-solution, it can work in one-to-many streaming configuration
* 🙂 compare to Bluetooth-solution, it can be controlled either locally or remotely over HA 
* 🙂 compare to Bluetooth-solution, it's active control, receiver decides when to start streaming, not the streaming source
* 🙂 compare to Bluetooth-solution, neither receiver nor sender is exposed to bluetooth network which can cause exteral unwanted connections
* 🙁 compare to Bluetooth-solution, audio stream is not normalized. When the origin audio is louder, receiver part gets louder audio (it can be fixed)
* 🙁 requires basic soldering skills
* 🙁 it's only for HA users, it requires basic knowledge of defining new services in HA
* 🙁 the audio is not really synchronous. From the other point of view, I cannot be in the few rooms simultaneously, so I don't need really need to have fully synchronous audio
* 🙁 the streaming part(linux-based PC) is not yet cross-platform, although it can be configured for Windows and MacOS too

## Things To Improve

After using the player for 2 weeks I got some requests for this device:
- (if there will be requests) add HOW-TO for streaming side on Windows or MacOS
- (if there will be requests) add solution without LCD display, just with the buttons
- normalized audio on receiver, so sound level on streaming part is not dependend on receiver part
- add docker file for setting-up streaming side
- add opportunity to control the sound level of streaming side from the audio player
- improve state synchronization between HA and the player (If the device restarted I cannot start to listen stream from HA. But it can be fixed)

## My Feedback

First things first, it solved my problem, so the device turn to be a useful, at least for me. The device is small and can be taped on a flat wall or on a shelf (that's what I did). The cable placing is okay. Would be better to have both connected from one side (although for such a small device it's not really possible).
For the negative sides, 2 times I observed that the audio stuck after 2-3 minutes of playing. Once there was some noise in the stream (most probably related to the poor WI-FI connection). Simple device restart fixed all those cases.
