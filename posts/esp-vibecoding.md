## Description

Last week I was experimenting with copilot agent GPT-4.1 (released 2025.04.14) and I was curious how it solves the tasks from the embedded development world. As a hardware target I used [ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.28](https://www.waveshare.com/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.28.htm) development board. The outcome of it was 3 games which ewre 95% generated by the agent. I give 5% for manual debuging and fixes. In generally I am more than happy with the outcome.

All of the games are using IMU for the game control. The list:

- **Dice** - simple game that shows a random number after shaking the MCU
- **Ball in Hole** - the ball has to be droped to the hole by tilting MCU
- **Tennis** - classical game against NPC with the tennis score. The player can by moved by tilting the MCU

Short demo of the games:

The repository with the game is [located HERE](https://github.com/techrecords/esp-touch-lcd128-vibecoding). Feel free to try or/and exetend it. Quick Start is in README.md file. Happy codding!
